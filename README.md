# UNIPATH

**AI-assisted university application support system for prospective students.**

UNIPATH helps students discover universities that fit their academic profile, track their applications, compare programs side by side, and get conversational guidance from an LLM-powered advisor — all from a single web app.

> Undergraduate graduation project — College of Software Engineering, Sichuan University.

---

## Features

- 🎓 **University search & filtering** — filter by GPA eligibility, city, program, and language of instruction.
- 🤖 **AI advisor (chat)** — conversational guidance powered by an LLM, with context awareness over the chat history (tracks mentioned majors, detects when the user wants alternatives, extracts interests).
- ⭐ **Personalized recommendations** — programs and universities matched to the student's profile (GPA, interests, preferred city, language, target program).
- 📋 **Application tracker** — track deadlines, required documents, and application status across multiple universities.
- 🔀 **Side-by-side comparison** — compare multiple universities on key attributes.
- 👤 **Student profile** — persisted academic profile that feeds both recommendations and the advisor.
- 📊 **Dashboard** — overview of saved universities, tracked applications, and upcoming deadlines.
- ⏰ **Deadline reminders** — scheduled email reminders via a background job.
- 🔐 **Authentication** — handled via Clerk.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 14 (developed and tested on PostgreSQL 16)
- A **Clerk** account (for authentication keys)
- An **OpenRouter** API key (for the AI advisor)
- *(Optional)* **Cloudinary** account if you want to populate university images
- *(Optional)* SMTP credentials if you want deadline reminder emails to actually send

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hala-404/Unipath.git
cd Unipath
```

### 2. Set up the database

```bash
# Create the database
createdb unipath_db

# Run migrations
psql unipath_db -f backend/db/migrations/001_add_profile_columns.sql

# Load seed universities
psql unipath_db -f backend/db/seeds/universities_seed.sql
```

### 3. Configure backend environment

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/unipath_db

# Auth (Clerk)
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx

# AI
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxx

# Email (optional — required for deadline reminders)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM="UniPath <noreply@unipath.app>"

# Cloudinary (optional — required for image population scripts)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

### 4. Install and run the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`. You can verify it's up by hitting `http://localhost:5000/health`.

### 5. Configure frontend environment

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

### 6. Install and run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Current coverage is limited to smoke tests for the health endpoint and the universities endpoint.
Current coverage also includes chat helper logic, chat prompt construction, and duplicate tracker protection.

## Testing & Quality

- Backend tests implemented with Jest
- Unit tests for chat helpers and prompt logic
- Endpoint tests for core APIs
- Coverage reporting enabled
- CI pipeline runs tests and builds frontend

---

## How the AI Advisor Works

The chat advisor (`backend/controllers/chat.controller.js`) is **not** a trained model — it is an LLM wrapper with rule-based routing around it:

1. The user message and recent conversation history are normalized.
2. Helper functions (`wantsAlternatives`, `extractMentionedMajors`, `extractInterestsFromHistory`) inspect the conversation for intent and context.
3. The user's profile and a filtered set of candidate universities from PostgreSQL are injected into the system prompt.
4. The prompt is sent to `meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter.
5. The model's response is parsed (with `safeJsonParse` for structured outputs) and returned to the frontend.

This is an intentional design choice for the prototype: it keeps inference costs low and behavior predictable, while still providing a natural-language interface for students.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Small dataset.** The seed contains a curated set of universities; this is a prototype, not a production catalog.
- **Filter-based recommendations.** Matching is rule-based (GPA threshold + city/program/language filters), not learned from data.
- **Smoke-test coverage only.** Backend tests verify availability, not full controller behavior.
- **No real-time data ingestion.** University information is static seed data.
- **Email reminders require SMTP configuration** to actually send.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Real-time data ingestion (web scraping + scheduled refresh)
- [ ] Document storage for application materials
- [ ] Scholarship and financial aid recommendations
- [ ] Expanded AI advisor (personal statement feedback, CV tips)
- [ ] Community features (forums, Q&A)
- [ ] Expand test coverage to controller-level
- [ ] Larger university dataset
